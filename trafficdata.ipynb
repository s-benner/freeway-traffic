    "This notebook contains a data analysis project related to traffic count on the German freeway system. This is a purely recreational project that I created with the intent of learning data analysis methodologies with a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this notebook was obtained from the \"Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen\" webiste, www.bast.de. The website provides hourly data on all automated traffic counting stations on the German freeway system (\"Autobahn\"). This is used as the raw data for this project. The raw data file is farily large at around 1.6GB, which is an additional challenge in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used is from 2018, because at this moment the 2019 data was not available yet. However, this notebook can easily be changed to work with more recent data later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this workbook is data exploration and visualization. Since the data is provided, the sourcing data part of this project is very simple and easy. Also, I will not be using the data to make any kinds of prediction (at this point in time at least)\n",
    "\n",
    "So this project focused on the these main activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Analysis of the structural elements of the data provided\n",
    "    - Cleaning of the raw data, modifying the data to meet the needs of the analysis\n",
    "    - Analysing and visualizing interesting aspects of the data"
