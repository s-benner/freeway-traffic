# freeway-traffic project overview
A deep look into traffic counts from the German freeway system

## Introduction
On my way of developing and improving my skills in the field of data analytics, data visualization, data science and coding, this is the first project that I conducted. I have only recently started exploring data analytics using pyhton and jupyter notebooks. The best way to learn is doing projects, and this is the start of it.

## Project Overview
In this project, I am looking into the traffic count data from the German freeway system. I chose this topic, since the data is readily available from the "Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen" website. Therefore, I don't have to worry about the data collection too much and can focus this project on EDA (exploratory data analysis) and visualization.

The main goal of this project is for the to apply and thereby learn techniques of data analysis with python and jupyter notebooks. I will analyse the data and highlight interesting aspects of the data.

## Tools/Data Source

I will be using jupyter notebooks and python for this project.

The souce data for this project is a CSV-type text file containing hourly counts of traffic for all traffic meters on the German freeway system from the "Bundesanstalt für Straßenwesen" website (www.bast.de)

## Structure

The project is split into different sections. Links to the appropriate notebooks are provided here:
